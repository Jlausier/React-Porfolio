  "aboutMe1": "My name is Jacob Lausier. I am a 29-year-old father of two Beautiful girls. I was born and raised in Maine before moving to Florida at age 16. I spent nine years working primarily in food and beverage, along with a few other roles, but I knew I wanted to pursue a career that challenged me more and provided long-term growth. Discovering coding and web development gave me that opportunity. Since making the transition, I have developed a genuine passion for technology and problem-solving, and my goal is to build a long-term career in this field that allows me to both enjoy my work and provide a stable future for my family.",

  "aboutMe2": "Outside of work, I enjoy a wide range of hobbies. I like board games, movies, and video games, but I also enjoy staying active through activities like rock climbing and mini golf. Having diverse interests makes it easy for me to connect with people from many different backgrounds. I consider myself an open-minded ambivert, meaning I am comfortable working independently while also thriving in team environments."
