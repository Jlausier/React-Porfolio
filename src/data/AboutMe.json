  "aboutMe1": " My name is Jacob Lausier. I am a 26 year old father of two girls together with my fiance, Mallory. Originally, I was born and raised in Maine. My family and I moved to Florida When I was 16. I worked mostly in food and beverage for nine years along with a few other jobs. I never liked any of those jobs so i neeed a change. Coding and web development was the change I thought I needed. Since making that jump I have found a passion for this line of work and hope to make it my career moving forward. My hope is it will allow me to love my job and provide for my family. ",

I think this makes it wasy for me to get along with a wide varity of people. Overall I would describe myself as an open minded ambivert, a combination of introvert and extrovert."
