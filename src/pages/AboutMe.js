      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am 26 years old, I was born and raised in Maine for 16 years that when I moved to Florida. I am a father, I have one little girl and another on the way. My daughters name is Aria. I also am engaged to my wonderful partner Mallory. I worked in food a beverage for nine years, ever since moving to Florida. Now I am coding hoping to find a passion for the work that I will everyday, as it was not food and beverage. Also being able to make the money needed to provide for my family, my family always comes first.
I enjoy video games, board games, tv and movies. As well as going out and doing fun activities, such as escape rooms, mini golf, rock climbing, and working out at the gym. I would describe myself as a ambivert. I am an open minded and kind individual to everyoine I meet.</p>
